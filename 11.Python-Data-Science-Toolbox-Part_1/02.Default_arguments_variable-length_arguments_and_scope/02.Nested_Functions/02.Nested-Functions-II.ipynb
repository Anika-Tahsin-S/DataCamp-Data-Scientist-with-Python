    "### Nested Functions II\n",
    "Great job, you've just nested a function within another function. One other pretty cool reason for nesting functions is the idea of a closure. This means that the nested or inner function remembers the state of its enclosing scope when called. Thus, anything defined locally in the enclosing scope is available to the inner function even when the outer function has finished execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's move forward then! In this exercise, you will complete the definition of the inner function inner_echo() and then call echo() a couple of times, each with a different argument. Complete the exercise and see what the output will be!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete the function header of the inner function with the function name inner_echo() and a single parameter word1.\n",
    "- Complete the function echo() so that it returns inner_echo.\n",
    "- We have called echo(), passing 2 as an argument, and assigned the resulting function to twice. Your job is to call echo(), passing 3 as an argument. Assign the resulting function to thrice.\n",
    "- Hit Submit to call twice() and thrice() and print the results.\n"
