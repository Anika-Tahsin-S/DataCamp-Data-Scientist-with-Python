    "Flexible arguments enable you to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. In this exercise, you will practice defining a function that accepts a variable number of string arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function you will define is gibberish() which can accept a variable number of string values. Its return value is a single string composed of all the string arguments concatenated together in the order they were passed to the function call. You will call the function with a single string argument and see how the output changes with another call using more than one string argument. Recall from the previous video that, within the function definition, args is a tuple.\n",
