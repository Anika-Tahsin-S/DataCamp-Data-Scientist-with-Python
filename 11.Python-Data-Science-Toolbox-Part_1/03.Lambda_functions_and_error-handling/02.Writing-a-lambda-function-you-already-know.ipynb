    "Some function definitions are simple enough that they can be converted to a lambda function. By doing this, you write less lines of code, which is pretty awesome and will come in handy, especially when you're writing and maintaining big programs. In this exercise, you will use what you know about lambda functions to convert a function that does a simple task into a lambda function. Take a look at this function definition:"
