    "Sometimes, we make mistakes when calling functions - even ones you made yourself. But don't fret! In this exercise, you will improve on your previous work with the count_entries() function in the last chapter by adding a try-except block to it. This will allow your function to provide a helpful message when the user calls your count_entries() function but provides a column name that isn't in the DataFrame.\n",
