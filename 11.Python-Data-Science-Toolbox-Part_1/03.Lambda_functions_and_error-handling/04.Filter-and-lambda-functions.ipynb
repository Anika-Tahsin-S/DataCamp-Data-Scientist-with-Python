    "### Filter() and lambda functions\n",
    "In the previous exercise, you used lambda functions to anonymously embed an operation within map(). You will practice this again in this exercise by using a lambda function with filter(), which may be new to you! The function filter() offers a way to filter out elements from a list that don't satisfy certain criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal in this exercise is to use filter() to create, from an input list of strings, a new list that contains only strings that have more than 6 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the filter() call, pass a lambda function and the list of strings, fellowship. The lambda function should check if the number of characters in a string member is greater than 6; use the len() function to do this. Assign the resulting filter object to result.\n",
    "- Convert result to a list and print out the list.\n",
