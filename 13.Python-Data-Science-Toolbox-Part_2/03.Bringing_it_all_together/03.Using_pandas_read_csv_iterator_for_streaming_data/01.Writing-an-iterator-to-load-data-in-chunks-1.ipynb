    "Another way to read data too large to store in memory in chunks is to read the file in as DataFrames of a certain length, say, 100. For example, with the pandas package (imported as pd), you can do pd.read_csv(filename, chunksize=100). This creates an iterable reader object, which means that you can use next() on it.\n",

    "In this exercise, you will read a file in small DataFrame chunks with read_csv(). You're going to use the World Bank Indicators data 'ind_pop.csv', available in your current directory, to look at the urban population indicator for numerous countries and years.\n",
