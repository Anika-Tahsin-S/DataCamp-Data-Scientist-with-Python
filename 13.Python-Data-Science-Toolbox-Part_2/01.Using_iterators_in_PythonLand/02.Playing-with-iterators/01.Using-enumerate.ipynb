    "### Using enumerate\n",
    "You're really getting the hang of using iterators, great job!\n",
    "\n",
    "You've just gained several new ideas on iterators from the last video and one of them is the enumerate() function. Recall that enumerate() returns an enumerate object that produces a sequence of tuples, and each of the tuples is an index-value pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you are given a list of strings mutants and you will practice using enumerate() on it by printing out a list of tuples and unpacking the tuples using a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a list of tuples from mutants and assign the result to mutant_list. Make sure you generate the tuples using enumerate() and turn the result from it into a list using list().\n",
    "- Complete the first for loop by unpacking the tuples generated by calling enumerate() on mutants. Use index1 for the index and value1 for the value when unpacking the tuple.\n",
    "- Complete the second for loop similarly as with the first, but this time change the starting index to start from 1 by passing it in as an argument to the start parameter of enumerate(). Use index2 for the index and value2 for the value when unpacking the tuple.\n",
